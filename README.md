Hello everyone
This file is basically my MATLAB work of Signal and System Lab.
Basically the details of experiments are as under
1:- Basic MATLAB commands
2:- To prove Maximum Power Transfer theorem Using MATLAB
3:- To Make the Password Verification Code using OCTAVE
4:- To Plot Sine and Cosine Wave in one plot using MATLAB
5:- Write MATLAB code to perform Arithmetic operation Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division on signals
6:- Write MATLAB code for plotting Continuous-Time Signals, Discrete-Time Signals and Sampled-Signal.
7:- Write a MATLAB code to perform signal processing operations: amplitude scaling, Time shifting, Time scaling, and Time inversion.
8:- Write a MATLAB code to convolute two discrete time sequences. Plot all the sequences and verify the result by analytical calculation.
